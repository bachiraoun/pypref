# pypref
PYthon PREFrences or pypref creates an application's 
preferences file and allows for dynamically interacting, and updating preferences. 
Most applications have default settings and preferences and in general those are 
created and stored in a text file. At some point preferences are pulled and updated
by the application and the users.
pypref is especially designed to take care of this task automatically and make programing
application's preferences more desirable.
